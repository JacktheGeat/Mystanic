# [Head Signs](/)
This pack allows the creation of mini-blocks using the stonecutter.
Put in wood planks, and you can create various arrow "signs" from the wood type.

Blocks with sign variants:
* Birch
* Cherry
* Jungle
* Mangrove
* Oak
* Spruce
* Sandstone

I did not save any credits for the creators of the head textures, but all are sourced from [minecraft-heads.com](https://minecraft-heads.com/).
