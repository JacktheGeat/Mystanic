# Mystanic Datapack
Made by **Jack the GEAT**
Special thanks to [Misode](https://github.com/misode) and the [Gamemode4](https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/GM4_Datapacks/) datapack for the tools and inspiration.

This is a modular datapack that combines multiple datapacks I have made into one. Each of the datapack folders works independently of each other, excluding the minecraft datapack for obvious reasons.
    
Make sure you download the resource pack here:
  > add resource pack here when you can

just a quick disclaimer: this project is a WORK IN PROGRESS

also it could have spyware and viruses or something idk. its not like i made it or anything.<br />
that was a joke i made it it shouldnt break your computer or anything. probably.
    
added give commands: /function mystanic:give/(insert item here)<br />
also working on loot tables for all custom items. It will be a while don't judge me.

# Known Bugs:
  > Sword of Avarice buggs out at 214748 kills. if someone manages to get that many kills in a survival world, without commands or hacks, i will give you 100$. until then, thats just too big a number for me to care.
  >
  > Dungeons don't now generate underground, but they have a bubble around them. I will have to fix that later somehow.
