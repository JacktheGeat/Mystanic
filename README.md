just a quick disclaimer: this project is a WORK IN PROGRESS

MAJOR bugs, does absolutely NOTHING to base game yet, and half the stuff doesn't work.

that was a joke i made it it shouldnt break your computer or anything. probably.

# Known Bugs:
  > Sword of Avarice buggs out at 214748 kills. if someone manages to get that many kills in a survival world, without commands, i will give you 100$. until then, thats just too big a number for me to care.
