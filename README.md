Make sure you download the resource pack here:

just a quick disclaimer: this project is a WORK IN PROGRESS

MAJOR bugs, does barely ANYTHING to base game yet, and half the stuff doesn't work.

also it could have spyware and viruses or something idk. its not like i made it or anything.<br />
that was a joke i made it it shouldnt break your computer or anything. probably.

How to summon bee keeper, because it works now: 
  > go to flower forest<br />
  > break bee nests until warning appears<br />
  > break bee nests with 20% chance of beekeeper spawning
    
added give commands: /function mystanic:give/(insert item here)<br />
also working on loot tables for all custom items. It will be a while don't judge me.

# Known Bugs:
  > Sword of Avarice buggs out at 214748 kills. if someone manages to get that many kills in a survival world, without commands or hacks, i will give you 100$. until then, thats just too big a number for me to care.
  >
  > Dungeons don't now generate underground, but they have a bubble around them. I will have to fix that later somehow.
