# Mystanic Datapack
Made by **Jack the GEAT**
Special thanks to [Misode](https://github.com/misode) and the [Gamemode4](https://github.com/Gamemode4Dev/GM4_Datapacks/) datapack for the tools and inspiration.

This is a modular datapack that combines multiple datapacks I have made into one. Each of the datapack folders works independently of each other, excluding the minecraft datapack for obvious reasons.
    
Make sure you download the resource pack here:
