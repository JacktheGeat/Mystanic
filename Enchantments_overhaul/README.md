# Enchantments, Advancements, and Tweaks
Have you ever noticed how tridents can't get sharpness, or crossbows can't get infinity? Thats really stupid. Crossbows still can't get infinity using this datapack, but arrows can explode, so I think its close enough.

In this datapack I am looking to fix some of the newer tools added to the game, like tridents being more easily acquirable, and actually being repairable. But also add more depth to them as well. 
Tridents and crossbows get unique enchantments highlighting their strengths, and new endgame enchantments are added as findable loot in dungeons, end cities, and bastions.

Some select enchantments also get unique particle effects as well. Frost walker now generates snowflake particles around your feet, and respiration has bubbles appear over your head while in water. This might get removed later, as I don't think it makes sense to add particles for only a handful of specific enchantments, but they look cool.

## New Enchantments:
 * Arctic Chill: Trident enchant that applies slowness to hit mobs, and will even freeze the block they are in if they are in water.
 * Streamline: Trident enchant that increases trident main attack speed (not throw speed). Also grants Dolphin's Grace effect when in water, and Speed 1 when its raining.
 * Explosive Arrows: Crossbow enchantment that causes arrows to explode when hitting an enemy. These explosions will damage the player and terrain as well, so be careful.
 * Implosive Arrows: Crossbow enchant that when hitting an entity, causes a small implosion, pulling in nearby mobs. Implosion does not deal any damage to nearby mobs or terrain.
  * Currently not acquirable outside commands.
 * Resiliance: Armor enchant that grants an extra half heart for each level. A full set with Resiliance 5 doubles your life total.
  * It is mutually exclusive with protection-type enchantments.
 * Moonwalking: A boots enchantment acquirable in end cities. Decreases gravity and fall damage rate. Moonwalking does not increase safe fall distance, only decreases damage by a percent.
  * Mutually exclusive with feather falling.
 * Flame Walker: Boots enchantment that is the opposite of Frost Walker. You cannot take freezing damage, and you melt powdered snow and snow layer blocks nearby. Also turns cobblestone you walk over into stone in a very small radius.
  * Will be acquirable as an enchanatment in Bastions, currently not acquirable outside commands.
 * Halfling: Chestpiece enchantment that decreases player size and health. Speed and jump height are unaffected by size changes, only the player's hitbox, model, and viewpoint.
  * Currently not acquirable outside commands.
 * Longstrider: Leggings enchchantment that increases your step-height, so you can walk up a full block without needing to jump. Does not increase jump height as well, you just need to jump less.
  * Currently not acquirable outside commands.

## New Advancements:
 * On Ice: Granted when you use Arctic Chill on a creature in water, turning where it stands into frosted ice.

## Balancing:
 * Impaling: Added drowned to the list of entities targeted by the damage increase, but also will deal increased damage to any entity so long as it is in water or in the open rain.
 * Sharpness: Now can be enchanted on tridents.
