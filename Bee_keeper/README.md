# [The Bee Keeper](/)
A brand new miniboss themed around our buzzing little friends: The Bee Keeper!

### Not the BEEEEEEES
Summoning an army of ever-angry bees that can sting several times, the Bee Keeper specializes in poisons and other debuffs. THe Bee Keeper has three attacks:
 * Summon Bees: Summons a pair of Bees
 * Summon Soldier: Summon a faster, stronger, and tougher bee.
 * Honey Spill: Throw a potion that afflicts any players hit with a slowness and jumping debuff, mimicking the effects of standing in a honey block.

### Sticky-Sweet prizes
Defeating the Bee Keeper grants a variety of bee-related items like blocks of honey, honeycomb, and honeycomb blocks.
Additionally there are a few bonus items:
 * Bee Keeper's Head
 * Bee Keeper's armor (netherite trims on custom dye color leather armor is such a flex.)
 * The Poison enchantment (works as you expect), either as a book or on the Bee Keeper's iron sword, the *Honey Stinger*

## Summoning:
Summon command: `/advancement grant @p only bee_keeper:adventure/bee_keeper_summon`

After breaking your third beehive, breaking a beehive in a flower forest, sunflower plains, or meadow biome has a chance (20%) to summon the Bee Keeper!

## Tips:
The Bee Keeper is vulnerable to both Smite and Bane of Arthropods. I would particularly recommend the latter, as the summoned bees are also weak to it, and it applies the slowness effect as well.

Milk will be incredibly useful when fighting the boss. Both the Bee Keeper and the bees it summons afflict poison damage, and the honey potions can be lethal if you get stuck in a corner. Milk will cleanse all of these effects, so make sure to carry a few buckets.
